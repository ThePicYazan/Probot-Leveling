# Self-Bot Discord Leveling System

This is a simple self-bot Discord leveling system using the `discord.js-selfbot-v13` and `sphinx-run` packages.

## Installation

To use this system, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required packages.

## Usage

1. Open the `config.json` file and replace `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with your Discord user token.
2. Open the `index.js` file and replace the channel ID in `channel: '1041129942898982985'` with the ID of the channel you want to use for leveling.
3. You can also change the time delay between each message by modifying the `time` property.
4. Save the changes and run the bot by typing `node index.js` in your command prompt or terminal.

Note: Using self-bots is against Discord's terms of service and can result in account termination.
